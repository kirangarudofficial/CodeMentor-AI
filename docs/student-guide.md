## Getting Started

### Step 1: Access the Platform

Your instructor will provide you with the URL:
```
http://<platform-url>
```

Open this URL in your web browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Edge recommended).

## Using the AI Coding Assistant

### Configure the AI Model

1. Click the **Settings** icon ⚙️ (usually in the top-right corner)

2. In the settings panel, find **"Base URL"** or **"LLM Configuration"**

3. Enter the internal model URL:
   ```
   http://ollama:11434
   ```

4. Select a model from the dropdown:
   - **tinyllama** - Fast responses, good for simple questions
   - **phi** - Better quality, slightly slower

5. Click **Save** or **Apply**

### Your First Prompt

Try asking:
```
Write a Python function that calculates factorial
```

The AI will respond in 1-3 seconds with code and explanation!

## Example Prompts

### 🐍 Python
```
- Explain this code: [paste your code]
- Write a function to find prime numbers up to N
- Convert this for loop to a list comprehension
- Debug this error: [paste error message]
```

### ☕ Java
```
- Create a class for a Student with name and age
- Implement a binary search algorithm
- Explain the difference between ArrayList and LinkedList
```

### 🌐 JavaScript
```
- Write a function to validate email addresses
- How do I fetch data from an API using async/await?
- Create a simple TODO list with HTML and JS
```

### 💾 Data Structures
```
- Implement a stack in Python
- Explain how a HashMap works
- Write a function to reverse a linked list
```

## Tips for Better Results

### ✅ DO:
- **Be specific**: "Write a Python function to sort a list of dictionaries by age"
- **Provide context**: "I'm learning Java and need help with inheritance"
- **Ask for explanations**: "Explain this code line by line"
- **Iterate**: If the response isn't perfect, ask follow-up questions

### ❌ DON'T:
- Paste entire assignments expecting complete solutions
- Use for exams or tests without permission
- Share sensitive or personal information
- Expect 100% accuracy - always review and test the code!

## Common Questions

### Q: Why is the AI sometimes wrong?
**A**: Small models make mistakes! Always:
- Test the code yourself
- Understand what it does
- Ask "why does this work?" to learn

### Q: Can I use this for homework?
**A**: Check with your instructor! This tool is for:
- ✅ Learning programming concepts
- ✅ Understanding syntax
- ✅ Debugging help
- ❌ Copying solutions without understanding

### Q: What if I get an error?
**A**: Paste the error message and ask:
```
I got this error: [error message]
Here's my code: [paste code]
What's wrong?
```

### Q: It's not responding!
**A**: Try:
1. Refresh the page
2. Check if you selected a model
3. Verify the base URL is correct
4. Ask your instructor for help

## Learning Best Practices

### 1. Understand, Don't Just Copy
```
❌ Bad: Copy code without reading
✅ Good: Ask "Can you explain this line by line?"
```

### 2. Experiment
```
Try variations:
- "Make this more efficient"
- "Add error handling"
- "Convert to a different language"
```

### 3. Learn from Explanations
```
Ask:
- "Why did you use a dictionary here?"
- "What's the time complexity?"
- "Are there alternative approaches?"
```

### 4. Build Incrementally
```
Start simple:
1. "Write a basic calculator"
2. "Add division with zero check"
3. "Support multiple operations"
4. "Add a user interface"
```

## Example Session

```
You: Write a Python function to check if a number is prime

AI: [provides code]

You: Explain how this works

AI: [provides explanation]

You: What's the time complexity?

AI: [explains Big O]

You: Can you make it faster?

AI: [provides optimized version]
```

## Responsible Use

### Academic Integrity
- Use AI as a **learning tool**, not a replacement for learning
- Understand every line of code you submit
- Cite AI assistance when required by your instructor

### Privacy
- Don't share: passwords, personal data, proprietary code
- This is a **learning environment** - treat it professionally
